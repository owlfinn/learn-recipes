                <h3>"I found this pancake recipe in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite."</h3>
                <p> Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff). </p>
